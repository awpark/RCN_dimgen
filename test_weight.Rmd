```{r}
set.seed(123) # for repro
g<-matrix(rpois(144,2),nrow=12) # col=hosts(12),row=para(12)

```

A hypothetical matrix with parasites as rows, hosts as columns, and cells referring to number of HxP records
```{r}
g
```

According to help file, this is the weighting applied to host PD metrics
```{r}
w<-t(g) %*% g # a weighting - to be explained
w
```

This is the abundance of each host
```{r}
colSums(g) # host abundances
```

This is the correlation of (x) the pairwise abundances of hosts and (y) the weighting applied
```{r}
j.abund<-NULL # joint abundances of pairs of hosts
for (i in 1:11){
  for (j in (i+1):12){
    j.abund<-c(j.abund,sum(g[,i],g[,j]))
  }
}

plot(j.abund,w[lower.tri(w)])
```

So I guess this weighting is an approximation to the pairwise abundances of hosts.
